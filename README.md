# Campus Calendar for ETH Zurich 

Freshmen students at the ETH Zurich can have a very hard time to find out the correct location of the lecture. ETH has over 100 buildings distributed in different parts of the city. This web applications adresses this problem.

This is a web application which helps students to get information about their weekly course schedule on a map in a user friendly and interactive way by importing a calendar from the ETH student portal. A map view and a calendar view are the main parts of the application. By selecting a specific lecture in the calendar, the map view will be updated and shows the building and other information about this particular lecture. The benefit is that students can see the building on google maps rather than only having the building name from the student portal. This way, it is much easier to find the lecture room and be there on time.
