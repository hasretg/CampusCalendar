		<h3>Project Overview:</h3>
		<p>This project was created under the scope of the lecture "Cartography III" which is offered at the IKG at ETH Zurich.
		The assigment was to create a digital map on a web interface. We were free to choose, what kind of map we wanted to make and what functionalities should be provided. We decided to show a map of the campus and provide an ability to add a calender, so you can see where you lectures take place and at what time. We call it a spatio-temporal map. With the help of a timeslider you can easily slide through your day ;)</p>
